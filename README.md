I have used a personalized dataset from my family buisness as source for this major project. I have applised absic EDA principles and used linear reegression as it mainly deals with a a linear showacasing of the nomial varaiable with a another nomial variable in this case a simple "Rate of Interest" Vs " Premimum to be delivered by client". The Accuray of the origianl of the Finnancial Consultants and Money Management Companies was 53% whilst this model has performed significantly better to provide a 61.7 % accuracy. The accuracy can be improved with a more wide variety of dataset from varied avenues and implementation of different models sucha as Logistic Regression, etc.
